AB Testing UX LandingPage LunarTech CaseStudy from the Python for Data Science Course freecodecamp.org
# Overview
This repository contains a case study on A/B testing focused on optimizing the UX of a landing page for LunarTech. The project walks through the entire process from hypothesis formulation to statistical analysis, with a focus on increasing the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of the landing page.

# Business Goal
The primary business objective is to increase the **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** on the LunarTech landing page. The hypothesis is that changing the design of the call-to-action (CTA) button from Green to Red will result in a higher CTR.

# Hypothesis Formulation
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** Changing the CTA button from Green to Red does not affect the CTR.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Changing the CTA button from Green to Red increases the CTR.

# Data Exploration
## Key Metrics
- **Primary Metric:** Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- **Secondary Metrics:** Time on Page, Bounce Rate

# Statistical Test Selection
A **two-sample Z-test** was chosen to compare the CTRs between the control (Green button) and treatment (Red button) groups.

# Calculating Test Statistics
The Z-test statistic was calculated to assess the difference in CTRs. The notebook details the steps involved:
- Total Clicks per Group
- Pooled Estimates for Clicks per Group
- Pooled Variance
- Standard Error and Test Statistics

#Calculating P-Value and Statistical Significance
The P-value was computed to determine if the observed difference in CTRs is statistically significant. A significance level (ùõº) of 0.05 was used.

#Significance and Confidence Interval (CI)
- **P-value:** Calculated from the **Z-test**
- **95% Confidence Interval:** Range calculated for the difference in CTRs
If the P-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a statistically significant difference between the two groups.

#Practical Significance
Beyond statistical significance, the effect size and practical significance were evaluated to determine whether the observed difference is meaningful for the business.

#Conclusion
The A/B test results provided actionable insights into the impact of the CTA button color on CTR, guiding future design decisions for LunarTech's landing page.
